Hi, my name is Chris and this is a very basic game feed I made, it's not the best due to being kinda glitchy but im pertyy happy. The code is gonna be sloppy so sorry about that. I've had a little help from AI like how to center a div as well help with debug, But I didn't fully rely on it (let me know if I should stop doing that while learning). If anybody see's this, I would like some feed back on things to do to get better. I would also like help on where is the best place to learn back end development cause I really wanna get a carrer out of it. I've been off and on with coding for years now and I finally wanna commit now. I am super greatful for anybody who sees this and gives feedback, whether if it's bad or good!
p.s I just turned 18 and entered community college this week tryna aim for an associate's degree in CS, the language they are teaching is c++
